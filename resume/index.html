            <h2> Summary  </h2>
            <p>
                As a PharmD with a passion for medical information and analytics, I'm currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science. I leverage my existing
experience working with diverse teams in medical affairs to provide accurate, timely drug information and support clinical decision-making. This
experience, combined with my growing data science skills, equips me to contribute to quality improvement projects and enhance patient
outcomes through data-driven insights in the pharmaceutical industry and consulting firms.
